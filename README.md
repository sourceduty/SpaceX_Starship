When SpaceX's Starship launches, it uses a two-stage system consisting of the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster. All of the engines on both stages are typically intended for use during the launch sequence, rather than having specific engines designated as "backup" engines.

Super Heavy Booster: This is the first stage of the rocket, responsible for providing the initial thrust to leave Earth's atmosphere. As of the latest updates, the Super Heavy can have up to 33 Raptor engines. These engines are all used during liftoff to maximize thrust and efficiency. There aren’t engines specifically designated as backups; all contribute to the launch process.

Starship (Second Stage): The upper stage of the rocket, which is the actual Starship, has 6 Raptor engines. These are used for propulsion beyond the Earth's atmosphere and for maneuvering in space. Similar to the Super Heavy booster, all these engines are main engines; none are just for backup.

Thus, in total, a fully equipped Starship launch system can have up to 39 Raptor engines active and functioning, with none explicitly categorized as backup engines. They all play crucial roles in the different phases of the mission.

The number of engines that can fail without compromising a mission depends significantly on the specific phase of the flight and the mission requirements. SpaceX's Starship and its Super Heavy booster are designed with some degree of engine redundancy, meaning that the system can tolerate some engine failures and still complete its mission.

For the Super Heavy booster, which may have up to 33 Raptor engines, there is a relatively high level of redundancy. This is crucial during the initial lift-off and ascent phases, where losing an engine or two can generally be compensated for by the remaining operational engines. The exact number of engines that can fail without mission failure isn't publicly specified by SpaceX, but the design aims to ensure that the vehicle can tolerate multiple engine outages and still perform its necessary flight profile.

For the Starship upper stage, which has 6 Raptor engines, the redundancy is somewhat lower due to the smaller number of engines. However, even here, the system is designed to handle at least one engine failure during different phases of its mission, such as orbital insertion or landing. The precise impact of an engine failure on Starship would depend on when and during which flight maneuvers the failure occurs.

Elon Musk has mentioned in discussions that the Starship system is designed to handle multiple engine failures but has not given specific numbers. The exact tolerance levels likely vary based on the load, the specific mission trajectory, and other dynamic factors during a flight.

<details><summary>Redundancy Ratio</summary>
<br>

Quantifying the exact ratio or rate of redundancy for SpaceX's Starship involves looking at specific components and systems, understanding their design philosophy, and assessing how many backups or alternative methods are in place. Here are some estimated figures based on available information:

Engines

- Raptor Engines: The Starship has 6 Raptor engines (3 sea-level and 3 vacuum) while the Super Heavy booster has 33 Raptor engines. The redundancy ratio here can be interpreted in terms of engine-out capability:
- Starship: Can potentially complete its mission even if one or more engines fail (exact ratio depends on mission profile and remaining thrust capacity).
- Super Heavy: Designed to continue functioning with several engines out. If it can still perform its mission with, for example, 3 engines out, the redundancy rate would be roughly 10%.

Flight Control Systems

- Triple-Redundant Flight Computers: The flight control system uses three computers running in parallel. This means that at any given time, there are two backup systems available. The redundancy ratio here is:
- Ratio: 3:1 (primary:backup systems).

Life Support Systems

- Redundant Life Support Components: Critical components such as oxygen generation, carbon dioxide removal, and water recycling systems typically have at least one backup.
- Typical Ratio: 2:1 or higher for critical life support functions.

Power Systems

- Redundant Power Supplies: Starship is equipped with multiple power sources, including solar panels and batteries.
- Ratio: Multiple independent power generation and storage systems ensure continuous operation; the exact ratio may vary, but typically at least 2:1 or more.

Communication Systems

- Multiple Communication Channels: Redundant communication links ensure that loss of one channel does not sever contact with mission control.
- Ratio: 2:1 or more, as multiple communication systems (e.g., radio, satellite) are used.

Structural Redundancy

- Landing Legs: Starship has multiple landing legs to ensure stability upon landing.
- Ratio: Designed to remain stable even if one or more legs fail, typically ensuring a 1.5:1 or higher ratio of functional to redundant legs.

Overall System Redundancy

- System-Level Redundancy: Considering all critical systems combined, the overall redundancy rate can be approximated, but this depends on the specific mission requirements and design constraints.
- General Estimate: Typically, aerospace systems aim for redundancy rates in critical areas that provide at least one backup for each primary system, translating to a 2:1 ratio or higher across the board.

Example Calculations

- Engines: If Starship can operate with 4 out of 6 engines (2 engine redundancy), the redundancy rate is 33% (2 out of 6).
- Flight Computers: With triple redundancy, the failure of one system means 2 backups are still available, implying a 200% redundancy rate.
- Life Support: Redundancy for oxygen generation may involve a primary system with a fully independent backup, indicating a 100% redundancy rate.

Conclusion

While the exact ratios can vary depending on specific mission parameters and the exact system configurations, the general approach for Starship involves at least a 2:1 redundancy in most critical systems, ensuring that for every primary system, there is at least one backup available to maintain functionality in the event of a failure.

<details><summary>On-Board Replacement Engines Concept</summary>
<br>

SpaceX's Starship could be designed to carry physical replacement engines that could be replaced in-flight by ejecting spent engines. However, implementing such a system presents significant technical challenges and complexities. Here are some key considerations:

Feasibility and Challenges

1. Structural Design

- Engine Mounting: The rocket's structure would need to accommodate additional engines securely, ensuring they are not only safely stored but also easily accessible for replacement.
- Reinforcement: The structure must be reinforced to handle the stresses of carrying and replacing engines, particularly during launch and in space.

2. Mechanism for Engine Replacement

- Ejection System: A reliable system to eject spent engines without damaging the rocket or other engines would be required.
- Installation System: A precise and automated system to install replacement engines in the correct position and orientation is necessary. This system must ensure proper alignment, secure attachment, and integration with fuel, oxidizer, and control systems.

3. Weight and Space Considerations

- Increased Mass: Carrying additional engines increases the mass of the rocket, which could reduce the payload capacity and impact overall mission efficiency.
- Space Constraints: Space within the rocket is limited, and designing storage and replacement systems for engines would require careful planning to avoid interfering with other critical systems.

4. Control and Integration

- Automated Systems: Advanced automated systems would be required to manage the ejection and installation processes, including robotics and real-time control algorithms.
- Redundancy: The replacement system itself would need redundancy to ensure it can operate correctly even if part of it fails.

5. Safety and Reliability

- Risk of Failure: The ejection and replacement processes introduce new failure modes, which could compromise the mission if not properly managed.
- Testing and Validation: Extensive testing and validation would be required to ensure the system works reliably in the harsh conditions of space.

Current State and Future Prospects

As of now, carrying and replacing engines in-flight is not a feature of existing rockets, including SpaceX's Starship. The current approach focuses on maximizing engine reliability and designing for reusability, where engines can be refurbished and reused after returning to Earth.

However, future advancements in robotics, automation, and materials science could make such a system feasible. The concept aligns with the broader goals of enhancing mission flexibility and robustness, especially for long-duration missions to Mars or beyond.

Conclusion

While theoretically possible, the concept of carrying and replacing engines in-flight presents significant technical challenges. The complexity, increased weight, space constraints, and need for advanced automated systems make it a challenging proposition with current technology. Future advancements may pave the way for such innovations, but for now, the focus remains on optimizing engine reliability and reusability.

```
E = Elon Musk's energy (in gigawatts)
S = SpaceX's rocket launches per year
T = Tesla's electric cars produced per month
B = Boring Company's tunnels (measured in miles per month)
A = Average number of tweets by Elon per day

Then the equation for the Musk Multiverse might be:

E = (S * T^2) / (B + A)

Where:

- If S = 50 (SpaceX launches 50 rockets a year)
- T = 20,000 (Tesla produces 20,000 cars per month)
- B = 1.5 (Boring Company completes 1.5 miles of tunnel per month)
- A = 10 (Elon tweets 10 times a day on average)

Plugging in the numbers:

E = (50 * 20,000^2) / (1.5 + 10)
E = (50 * 400,000,000) / 11.5
E ≈ 1,739,130,435 gigawatts

Elon Musk's energy would be approximately 1.74 billion gigawatts, which seems about right for someone who's revolutionizing space travel, electric cars, tunneling, and social media simultaneously.
